# Decision Field Operator Lab

A bounded, exact calibration lab for the **state-space / decision-field / operator-builder** work.

This project connects:

- primitive construction;
- Boolean operators and their duals/opposites;
- permutation and symmetry;
- iterable/enumerable/calculable search contracts;
- the signed consequential-change projection `-S' / 0 / +S'`;
- the 4D Compass orientation grammar;
- `PROPOSE → VERIFY → ADMIT_UNIQUE → PROMOTE`.

It does **not** treat XOR as a universal decision law. XOR is one discriminator inside a larger operator field.

## Computational contract

### Mathematical question

Can a small audited builder:

1. enumerate the complete binary Boolean operator space;
2. construct every Boolean behavior from a tiny primitive basis;
3. organize a finite signed 4D orientation space by certified symmetry;
4. keep consequential gain, consequential loss, representation-only motion and unresolved status separate;
5. compare operators under declared obligations without pretending that one operator is universally optimal?

### Exact surrogate implemented here

- Boolean domain: all functions `f : {0,1}² → {0,1}`.
- Complete behavior count: `2^(2^2) = 16`.
- Primitive construction basis: binary `NAND`.
- Construction model: straight-line/DAG-style reuse of previously available Boolean masks.
- Search bound: at most 5 NAND gates, deterministic semantic-state deduplication, no beam truncation in the published audit.
- Compass domain: every nonzero vector in `{-1,0,+1}^4`.
- Compass symmetry: coordinate permutations plus independent sign changes.
- Consequential-change score: independent `gain`, `loss`, `magnitude`, signed projection, representation-only flag, cost and unresolved flag.
- Arithmetic: exact integers, finite sets and truth masks; no floating approximation is used except the derived signed ratio.

### What a pass establishes

For this declared finite calibration only:

- all 16 binary Boolean functions are enumerated;
- each has a verified NAND construction within the stated bound;
- the 80 signed 4D headings are enumerated;
- a separate signed-permutation construction reproduces the same four support-size orbits;
- the admission protocol detects semantic duplicates before promotion;
- the supplied balance fixtures select different operators when the obligations change.

### What it does **not** establish

- no universal novelty detector;
- no theorem that XOR is "balance";
- no claim that every decision field is finite or decidable;
- no claim that enumeration implies decision;
- no P-versus-NP consequence;
- no transfer of the NAND gate costs here into another project's cost model;
- no claim that `S'` is observer-independent or obligation-independent.

## Exact finite results

The committed concise audit currently records:

- **16 / 16** binary Boolean operators;
- every behavior NAND-constructible within **≤ 5** gates in the declared straight-line model;
- `XOR` shortest witnessed construction: **4** NAND gates;
- `XNOR` shortest witnessed construction: **5** NAND gates;
- negative control: `XNOR` is **not** reached within the exhaustive 4-gate search;
- **80** nonzero signed 4D headings;
- support-size split: **8 + 24 + 32 + 16**;
- the same split is independently reconstructed as four signed-permutation orbits.

The Compass orbit templates are therefore:

```text
(1,0,0,0)
(1,1,0,0)
(1,1,1,0)
(1,1,1,1)
```

Signs and coordinate permutations generate the 80 oriented headings.

## Operator field

The exact Boolean registry includes all 16 truth tables, including:

`AND`, `NAND`, `OR`, `NOR`, `XOR`, `XNOR`, both implications, both directional differences, both negations, projections, and constants.

The wider registry also names structural operators such as:

`PRESERVE`, `PERMUTE`, `CANONICALIZE`, `SPLIT`, `MERGE`, `REPAIR`, `MUX`, `FILTER`, `THRESHOLD_K`, and `EXACTLY_K`.

Those wider operators are deliberately marked **incomparable on the binary Boolean fixtures** unless an explicit domain bridge is provided. Registration is not the same as pretending they share one truth-table semantics.

## Signed S′ discipline

For declared consequential distinctions:

```text
gain  = after - before
loss  = before - after
magnitude = gain + loss
signed = (gain - loss) / magnitude
```

when `magnitude > 0`.

This deliberately preserves the case:

```text
gain = 1
loss = 1
signed = 0
magnitude = 2
```

as **real change whose signed projection cancels**, not "nothing happened."

A pure permutation or representation change receives `representation_only=true` only when the protected distinction set is unchanged.

## Balance experiment

The same 16 Boolean operators are ranked under the same cost-vector form:

```text
(violations, NAND-gates, operator-id)
```

but with different declared obligations.

The finite fixtures intentionally produce different winners:

- exclusive change → `XOR`;
- agreement → `XNOR`;
- intersection → `AND`;
- coverage → `OR`;
- endpoint-preserving symmetric partial obligation → `AND`.

So the experiment rejects the shortcut:

```text
XOR == universal balance
```

while retaining XOR as a useful separator when the obligation really is exclusivity/difference.

No unweighted sum of unlike costs is called a total optimum.

## Algorithmic-builder protocol

The admission machine is:

```text
PROPOSE
  ↓
VERIFY
  ↓
ADMIT_UNIQUE
  ↓
PROMOTE
```

A verified composite can become a reusable builder primitive while its derivation remains available. A second construction with the same semantic key is retained as `DUPLICATE` rather than manufactured into novelty.

## GSFL successor profiles

The canonical six-operator loop above remains unchanged. Additional GSFL behavior is carried through removable successor profiles rather than silently redefining canonical operators.

### GSFL v0.1 operator projection

`gsfl-operator-profile.json` projects the completed GSFL v0.1 operations into reusable operators while preserving separate semantic, evidence, and authority effects.

### GSFL v0.1 bidirectional macro cycle

`gsfl-bidirectional-macro-profile.json` composes those verified operators into five macros:

```text
SEEK → QUESTION → REFRAME → BUILD → RETURN_INWARD
```

with exact expansion:

```text
SEEK          = OBSERVE → GROUND → TRACE_TOOL
QUESTION      = DISTINGUISH → COMPARE → AUDIT_CONFOUNDS
REFRAME       = MAP → ROTATE → RELATE → PRESERVE
BUILD         = COMPOSE → REPAIR → VERIFY → SELECT → HANDOFF
RETURN_INWARD = RECONSTRUCT → TEACH_BACK → DERIVE_COROLLARIES
                 → COMPARE → PRESERVE → FIT
```

The macro profile uses 19 unique existing operators across 21 invocations. It is a composition layer, not a primitive-authority layer. See [`GSFL_BIDIRECTIONAL_MACRO_CYCLE.md`](docs/GSFL_BIDIRECTIONAL_MACRO_CYCLE.md).

```text
MACRO != NEW_PRIMITIVE
OUTWARD_EXPLORATION != VALIDATION
INWARD_COHERENCE != PROOF
BUILD != TRUTH
```

## RMAPL / Ω bounded reference runtime

This lab also contains the bounded **RMAPL 0** conditional repair/fitting profile and the strict `rmapl-omega/v0` interchange/inspection envelope.

The implementation is deliberately additive:

- `omega.py` — strict deterministic Ω normalization, identity, inspection records, and reconstruction/loss reports;
- `omega.schema.json` — closed Draft 2020-12 interchange schema;
- `omega_adapters.py` — native Decision Field, S'1, GSFL, image-surface, dimensional-ladder, Suggest, and Hodge projections with explicit native remainder;
- `rmapl.py` and `RMAPL_V0_GRAMMAR.md` — exact small RMAPL v0 parser/IR;
- `rmapl_runtime.py` — bounded conditional repair/fitting execution, typed evidence admission, consequential-equivalence quotienting, Pareto branch preservation, Knowledge Decay accounting, side-effect guards, and cycle/resource stop certificates;
- `run_rmapl_omega_audit.py` + `evidence/RMAPL_OMEGA_RESULTS.json` — deterministic frozen bounded evidence.

Native schemas remain authoritative. Ω is a projection, not a replacement. RMAPL 0 is a reference profile and is **not** claimed as an RMALC frontend.

```text
OMEGA_VIEW != NATIVE_OBJECT
RMAPL_PROFILE != RMAL_CORE_FRONTEND
METHOD_TRANSFER != EVIDENCE_TRANSFER
SOFTWARE_VERIFICATION != SCIENTIFIC_VALIDATION
MAXIMAL_WITHIN_DECLARED_SCOPE != GLOBAL_COMPLETENESS
```

Design and derivation records:

- [September 20 successor design](../../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-20-rmapl-omega-conditional-repair-design.md)
- [September 20 domain collation](docs/RMAPL_OMEGA_DOMAIN_COLLATION_2026-09-20.md)
- [implementation plan](../../../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-20-rmapl-omega-reference-runtime.md)

## S′ Carrier–Surface executable bridge

The current-working S′ semantic model layer is also exercised through an additive Carrier–Surface bridge:

- `s1_carrier_surface.py` — same-object projection, reconstruction, invariant comparison, residual typing, Ω transport, and one-degree schedule repair;
- `fixtures/s1_current_semantic_object.json` — one bounded common object spanning candidate-state, Survivor, SemanticWorkUnit, and multi-timescale Surfaces;
- `run_s1_carrier_surface_audit.py` + `evidence/S1_CARRIER_SURFACE_RESULTS.json` — deterministic replay of four round trips, Ω second-transport checks, reconstruction-loss/tamper negatives, and one-degree repair;
- `docs/S1_CARRIER_SURFACE_BRIDGE.md` — contract and claim boundary.

```text
OBJECT IDENTITY IS INVARIANT; COORDINATES ARE NEGOTIABLE
CURRENT_WORKING_MODEL != OWNER-PINNED_IMPLEMENTATION
S_PRIME_CANDIDATE != ADMITTED_SUCCESSOR
PROJECTION_SUCCESS != RECONSTRUCTION_SUCCESS
METHOD_TRANSFER != EVIDENCE_TRANSFER
```

This does not replace the native S′ Models Lab or promote the newer working semantic models to scientific authority.

## Adversarial RMAPL / Ω stress verification

`run_rmapl_omega_stress.py` applies a deterministic fixed-seed adversarial corpus across five families:

- **2,048** Ω canonicalization / identity / tamper cases;
- **1,536** valid-plus-malformed RMAPL parser cases;
- **1,024** runtime evidence / mutation / quotient / cycle cases;
- **512** cross-domain adapter authority cases;
- **256** RMAL bidirectional-response boundary escalation counterprobes.

The frozen default corpus is **5,376** cases at seed `20260920`. Unit tests rerun it for determinism and at scale ×2. CI additionally runs scale ×4 (**21,504 cases**) and then verifies the frozen default report byte-for-byte.

The RMAL response carrier is deliberately tested as a boundary sentinel: its current `NOT_REVALIDATED` RMALC state and no-generic-runtime claim must survive every stress pass.

```text
STRESS_PASS != PROOF
FIXED_SEED_STRESS != EXHAUSTIVE_VERIFICATION
SOFTWARE_VERIFICATION != SCIENTIFIC_VALIDATION
AUTHORED_CARRIER != GENERIC_RESPONSE_RUNTIME
CONTROLLED_SURFACE_CHECK != RMALC_COMPILE
```

## Run

Python 3.10+; standard library only.

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s "projects/research/Decision Field Operator Lab" -p "test_*.py" -v
python "projects/research/Decision Field Operator Lab/run_audit.py" --check
python "projects/research/Decision Field Operator Lab/run_gsfl_operator_audit.py" --check
python "projects/research/Decision Field Operator Lab/run_gsfl_bidirectional_audit.py" --check
python "projects/research/Decision Field Operator Lab/run_contextual_multicarrier_audit.py" --check
python "projects/research/Decision Field Operator Lab/run_rmapl_omega_audit.py" --check
python "projects/research/Decision Field Operator Lab/run_rmapl_omega_stress.py" --check
python "projects/research/Decision Field Operator Lab/run_rmapl_omega_stress.py" --scale 4 --out /tmp/rmapl-omega-stress-scale4.json
```

`run_audit.py --check` reruns the exact finite operator-field contract. The GSFL audit commands independently reproduce the operator-projection and bidirectional-macro successor evidence.
