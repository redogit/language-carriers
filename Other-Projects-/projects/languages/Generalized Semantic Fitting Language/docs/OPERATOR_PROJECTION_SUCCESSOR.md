# GSFL v0.1 Operator Projection Successor

**Source lifecycle:** `COMPLETE_BOUNDED_V0_1`  
**Source completion merge:** `cf9d5a35a39b1a7b92f30e24b2789f659e913f04`  
**Successor target:** `projects/research/Decision Field Operator Lab/gsfl-operator-profile.json`

The completed GSFL v0.1 baseline is not reopened by this file. Its operations are projected outward as reusable operators in the Decision Field Operator Lab.

```text
GSFL COMPLETE_BOUNDED_V0_1
        ↓ read-only projection
GSFL_V0_1_OPERATOR_PROJECTION
```

The projection registers 23 operations:

```text
OBSERVE
DISTINGUISH
GROUND
MAP
RELATE
COMPARE
ROTATE
PRESERVE
COMPOSE
SPLIT
MERGE
COOPERATE
HANDOFF
TRACE_TOOL
TEACH_BACK
VERIFY
RECONSTRUCT
REPAIR
FIT
SELECT
GENERATE_PROVERB_FIXTURE
AUDIT_CONFOUNDS
DERIVE_COROLLARIES
```

`DISTINGUISH`, `GROUND`, `REPAIR`, and `SELECT` delegate to the canonical Decision Field operators. The other 19 have bounded reference implementations in the operator projection.

Each operator records semantic, evidence, and authority effects separately. The projection preserves:

```text
PROJECTION != SOURCE_MUTATION
OPERATOR_EXECUTION != AUTHORITY_TRANSFER
FIT != TRUTH
VERIFY != UNIVERSAL_TRUTH
MACHINE_OUTPUT != MACHINE_LEARNING_EVIDENCE
TOOL_USE != TOOL_AUTHORITY
PROVERB != EMPIRICAL_EVIDENCE
```

The authoritative implementation/evidence for this successor lives in the Decision Field Operator Lab. GSFL v0.1 remains complete for its previously declared bounded scope; the operator projection is a new successor surface.
